			<h3>
				There are already <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=javascript+template" target="_blank">
				plenty of template solutions</a> available. Why make another?</h3>
			<div class="faqAnswer">
				
				<p>
					A lot of existing template engines force developers into situations where they must combine
					HTML and processing directives into a single entity. There are a few issues with this approach:
				</p>
					
				<ul>
					<li>
						The duties of a designer and programmer who deal with markup and JavaScript, respectively,
						are combined and may not easily be separated during development.
					</li>
					<li>
						The combination of HTML and JavaScript in the one entity will only lead to obtrusive
						JavaScript, as opposed to
						<a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/The_principles_of_unobtrusive_JavaScript" target="_blank">
						unobtrusive JavaScript</a>, which is arguably more desirable.
					</li>
					<li>
						There may be significant overhead in interpreting non-JavaScript directives embedded
						in HTML.
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					Additionally, existing solutions may be incorporated in a larger library of code and/or
					provide extraneous functionality which is not directly related to templating. A good
					example is the use of AJAX built in to the code to retrieve template data. That is not
					to say those features are not useful to have, but rather could be provided by another,
					potentially custom, API.
				</p>
					
				<p>
					Penguin aims to be able to provide a clear-cut separation between the markup and JavaScript
					used in templating, while being minimal but powerful enough for developers to be as expressive
					as they please.

			<a class="permalink" name="evil-eval" href="#evil-eval">¶</a>
			<h3>eval is evil. Why is it used in Penguin?</h3>
			<div class="faqAnswer">
				<p>
					If a logical component is given for a precompiled template, it must be converted from a string
					as defined in HTML, to a native JavaScript function. This is done with eval(). However, 
					eval()'s use is contentious in the JavaScript community as it permits the execution of an
					arbitrary string of JavaScript. However, as long as the string has been generated by a trusted
					source (a server, for instance), it is no less secure than any other JavaScript, such as those
					already included with the web page. You should be more concerned with
					<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Man-in-the-middle_attack" target="_blank">man-in-the-
					middle attacks</a> instead.	A more legitimate cause for concern with eval() is how inefficient
					it is because of the need to invoke the JavaScript interpreter. In Penguin however, eval() is
					only used to define a function. It is not used for any other purpose or to execute any other
					code. Additionally, if a template needs to be copied (which may occur when DataBinding a
					collection), a copy of the function object is made; the string used for the function is not
					passed back to the interpreter. Regardless, any overhead incurred by eval() in Penguin is
					considered negligible and its use justified given the functionality it provides.
