Penguin is the JavaScript template library I created as part of my Honours degree research at Deakin University in 2013.

I have provided copies of the Penguin library and my accompanying thesis, [_Decreasing Data Transfer on the Web with Templates_](https://github.com/endail/penguin/raw/main/Decreasing%20Data%20Transfer%20on%20the%20Web%20with%20Templates.pdf), in the hope they are found to be useful.
